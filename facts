# Locator, use id as CSS - #loginusername

# JavaScript asynchronized language programming

# Semicolon (;) is optional

# By default, PlayWright runs all test in headless mode

# async makes the function to return a promise

# await makes the function to wait for a promise

() => {} - Callback function

ex:
const {test, expect} = require('@playwright/test');

test('Home Page', async ({page})=> {
    await page.goto('https://demoblaze.com/index.html');
})

await page.goto will wait until async ({page}) is loaded(the promise)
